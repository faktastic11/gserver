Extract all numerical data from this transcript labeled \"Excerpt\" to create a json of and array line items objects . The JSON Schema should look as follows: {[{\"rawLineItem\": string, \"rawPeriod\": string, \"rawLow\": number or string, \"rawHigh\": number, \"rawUnit\": string, \"rawScale\": string, \"metricType\": stirng, \"rawTranscriptSourceSentence\": string,}]}The first field is the line item name. The second field is the period being referenced in the sentence (assume \"this quarter\" unless referring expectations or outlook, which would be \"next quarter\" - only use \"this year\" or \"next year\" if the speaker refers to year. Note that saying \"year over year\" or comparing to previous year does not mean the reference period is a year). The third and fourth fields are \"low\" and \"high\". If data is given for a range, use low and high. If not in a range, use low only and put null for high. In the fifth field describe the unit of the line item (examples: percentage, USD, EUR). In the sixth field put the scale of the line item (examples: thousands, millions, billions, basis points). In the seventh field put whether the statement is historical data or forward looking guidance, use retrospective or guidance only. In the field column include the source sentence where the number in that row was found. Return TERMINATE if there is no financial data. Excerpt: {excerpt}.",
