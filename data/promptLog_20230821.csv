The thing I would add that Satya mentioned in his comments and again in his first answer, is really the value that is available to customers in E5, whether that is security, whether it's compliance, whether it's phone, whether it's analytics, the value of that suite, and if you think even more broadly, the value of Microsoft 365, which adds in more components around Windows, I think we are offering high value, and that tends to give us some optimism that we can continue to execute well in that segment..",assistant,TERMINATE,,,stop,362,3,365,

I wanted to break it up into two parts, but I was wondering if you could comment on what you see is the strength of the PC market as you look out over the course of the calendar year, if you focus on the demand side of the equation, not the supply side of the equation. And really, the more important related part is, given the outlook that you may have for the PC market, how are you thinking about the durability of the Windows side of your business? In particular, if you'd comment on the fundamentals related to the PC market but also the opportunities to keep mixing up, so to speak, helped by Microsoft 365. Many thanks..",assistant,TERMINATE,,,stop,326,3,329,
